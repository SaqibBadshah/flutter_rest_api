+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
+
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of

+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+Introduction
+============
+
+  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
+  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
+  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
+  FreeType Project.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
+  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
+  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
+  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
+
+  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
+  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
+  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
+  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
+
+    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
+      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
+
+    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
+      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
+
+    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
+      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
+      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
+      FreeType code. (`credits')
+
+  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
+  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
+  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
+  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
+
+  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
+  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
+  encourage you to use the following text:
+
+    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
+    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
+
+  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
+  actually use.
+
+Legal Terms
+===========
+
+0. Definitions
+
+  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
+  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
+  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
+  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
+  beta or final release.
+
+  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
+  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
+  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
+  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
+  engine'.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
+  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
+  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
+  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
+  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
+  this license, you must contact us to verify this.
+
+  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
+  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
+  specified below.
+
+1. No Warranty
+
+  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
+  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
+  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
+  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
+  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
+  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
+
+2. Redistribution
+
+  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
+  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
+  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
+  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
+  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
+  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
+  herein, subject to the following conditions:
+
+    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
+      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
+      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
+      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
+      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
+      files.
+
+    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
+      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
+      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
+      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
+      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
+
+  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
+  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
+  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
+  to us.
+
+3. Advertising
+
+  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
+  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
+  purposes without specific prior written permission.
+
+  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
+  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
+  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
+  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
+
+  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
+  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
+  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
+  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
+  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
+  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
+  of this license.
+
+4. Contacts
+
+  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
+
+    o freetype@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
+      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
+      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
+      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
+
+    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
+      specific licenses, porting, etc.

+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.

+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
+under terms compatible with the above MIT license:
+
+Much of the math library code (third_party/math/* and
+third_party/complex/*, and third_party/include/libm.h) is
+Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
+Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
+Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
+Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
+Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier
+and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
+have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
+
+The smoothsort implementation (third_party/smoothsort/qsort.c) is
+Copyright © 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style
+license.
+
+The x86_64 files in third_party/arch were written by Nicholas J. Kain
+and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
+
+All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
+produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
+by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
+contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
+can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
+omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
+interest of source tree size.
+
+In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
+(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
+applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
+the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
+license, and to use these files without any requirement of
+attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:
+
+Bobby Bingham
+John Spencer
+Nicholas J. Kain
+Rich Felker
+Richard Pennington
+Stefan Kristiansson
+Szabolcs Nagy
+
+all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.
+
+This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
+the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
+to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
+negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
+permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
+obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.

+
+A large portion of the dictionary entries
+originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
+Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
+
+Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
+original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
+that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
+on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
+in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
+distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
+contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
+jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
+
+NO WARRANTY
+
+The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
+research and development conducted during the project and is provided
+to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
+program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
+implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
+includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
+performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
+the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
+any right of any third party.
+
+Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
+have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
+the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
+otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
+
+Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
+organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
+development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
+officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
+damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
+and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
+with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
+or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
+regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
+knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
+project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
+foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
+"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
+modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
+production of secondary products from the program.
+
+In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
+modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
+any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
+grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
+writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
+from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
+above as far as the program is concerned.

+
+OVERVIEW
+========
+
+This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
+and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
+method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing
+photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and
+brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or
+other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG
+quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such
+images.
+
+JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to
+the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images,
+very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression
+artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are
+willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the
+compressor.)
+
+This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
+compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
+processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
+We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
+processes defined in the standard.
+
+We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
+plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
+perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
+The library is intended to be reused in other applications.
+
+In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
+considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
+for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
+decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
+colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
+library if not required for a particular application.
+
+We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
+different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
+applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
+
+The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
+flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
+the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
+REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
+be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
+achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.
+
+We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
+No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
+documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.

+   please let us know!)
+2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
+3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
+   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
+   you've used the IJG code.
+
+In legalese:
+
+The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
+with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
+fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
+its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

+the Independent JPEG Group".
+(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
+full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
+NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
+
+These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
+not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
+acknowledge us.
+
+Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
+in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
+it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
+software".
+
+We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of

+
+The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
+It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
+The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
+ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
+but is also freely distributable.
+
+The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
+To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
+support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
+to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
+algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
+by all standard GIF decoders.
+
+We are required to state that

+    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of

+
+REFERENCES
+==========
+
+We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
+understand the innards of the JPEG software.
+
+The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
+	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
+	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
+(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
+applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
+handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
+available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually
+a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
+omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
+and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
+and it may not be used for commercial purposes.
+
+A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
+"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
+M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
+good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
+including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
+code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
+sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
+at a full implementation, you've got one here...
+
+The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still
+Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
+Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
+Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
+standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).
+
+The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
+specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
+titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
+Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
+10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
+Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
+numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
+
+The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
+format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
+1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report
+and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free
+download in PDF format from
+http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.
+A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at
+http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at
+http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.
+
+The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
+ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
+found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
+IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
+Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
+(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
+http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
+of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
+Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
+uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.

+FILE FORMAT WARS
+================
+
+The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (also known as JPEG, together
+with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name
+"JPEG" which are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG.  IJG therefore does
+not support these formats (see REFERENCES).  Indeed, one of the original
+reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on
+common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.
+Don't use an incompatible file format!
+(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG
+image files indefinitely.)

+
+2. License Grants and Conditions
+
+2.1. Grants
+
+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
+
+    a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+    b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
+
+    a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
+
+    b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
+
+    c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+    a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+    b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
+
+6. Disclaimer of Warranty
+
+    Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
+
+7. Limitation of Liability
+
+    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
+
+8. Litigation
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
+
+If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.
+
+*  6. Disclaimer of Warranty
+
+*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"
+*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
+*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
+*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
+*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
+*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
+*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
+*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
+*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
+*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
+*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
+
+*  7. Limitation of Liability
+
+*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
+*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
+*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as
+*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
+*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
+*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
+*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
+*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
+*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
+*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
+*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the
+*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
+*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
+*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
+*  limitation may not apply to You.
+
+8. Litigation
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
+courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
+place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
+jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
+Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
+cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
+that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
+shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
+10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
+publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
+distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
+of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
+or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
+steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
+create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
+modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
+any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
+such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
+Licenses
+
+If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
+Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
+notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
+
+Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
+
+  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public
+  License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this
+  file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.
+
+If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular
+file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE
+file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
+for such a notice.
+
+You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.
+
+Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
+
+  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as
+  defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

+
+   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
+
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

+   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

+   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

+
+   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
+
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

+   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

+   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+

+Copyright 1996-2002, 2006 by
+David Turner, Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg
+
+Introduction
+============
+
+  The FreeType  Project is distributed in  several archive packages;
+  some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine,
+  various tools and  contributions which rely on, or  relate to, the
+  FreeType Project.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files found  in such  packages, and
+  which do not  fall under their own explicit  license.  The license
+  affects  thus  the  FreeType   font  engine,  the  test  programs,
+  documentation and makefiles, at the very least.
+
+  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
+  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
+  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
+  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:
+
+    o We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be
+      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)
+
+    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
+      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)
+
+    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
+      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
+      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
+      FreeType code. (`credits')
+
+  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
+  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
+  We  disclaim  all warranties  covering  The  FreeType Project  and
+  assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
+
+  Finally,  many  people  asked  us  for  a  preferred  form  for  a
+  credit/disclaimer to use in compliance with this license.  We thus
+  encourage you to use the following text:
+
+    Portions of this software are copyright © <year> The FreeType
+    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.
+
+  Please replace <year> with the value from the FreeType version you
+  actually use.
+
+Legal Terms
+===========
+
+0. Definitions
+
+  Throughout this license,  the terms `package', `FreeType Project',
+  and  `FreeType  archive' refer  to  the  set  of files  originally
+  distributed  by the  authors  (David Turner,  Robert Wilhelm,  and
+  Werner Lemberg) as the `FreeType Project', be they named as alpha,
+  beta or final release.
+
+  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
+  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
+  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
+  This  program is  referred to  as  `a program  using the  FreeType
+  engine'.
+
+  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
+  FreeType  Project,   including  all  source   code,  binaries  and
+  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
+  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
+  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
+  this license, you must contact us to verify this.
+
+  The FreeType  Project is copyright (C) 1996-2000  by David Turner,
+  Robert Wilhelm, and Werner Lemberg.  All rights reserved except as
+  specified below.
+
+1. No Warranty
+
+  THE FREETYPE PROJECT  IS PROVIDED `AS IS' WITHOUT  WARRANTY OF ANY
+  KIND, EITHER  EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,  INCLUDING, BUT NOT  LIMITED TO,
+  WARRANTIES  OF  MERCHANTABILITY   AND  FITNESS  FOR  A  PARTICULAR
+  PURPOSE.  IN NO EVENT WILL ANY OF THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
+  BE LIABLE  FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED  BY THE USE OR  THE INABILITY TO
+  USE, OF THE FREETYPE PROJECT.
+
+2. Redistribution
+
+  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
+  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
+  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
+  sublicense the  FreeType Project (in  both source and  object code
+  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
+  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
+  herein, subject to the following conditions:
+
+    o Redistribution of  source code  must retain this  license file
+      (`FTL.TXT') unaltered; any  additions, deletions or changes to
+      the original  files must be clearly  indicated in accompanying
+      documentation.   The  copyright   notices  of  the  unaltered,
+      original  files must  be  preserved in  all  copies of  source
+      files.
+
+    o Redistribution in binary form must provide a  disclaimer  that
+      states  that  the software is based in part of the work of the
+      FreeType Team,  in  the  distribution  documentation.  We also
+      encourage you to put an URL to the FreeType web page  in  your
+      documentation, though this isn't mandatory.
+
+  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
+  the FreeType Project,  not just the unmodified files.   If you use
+  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
+  to us.
+
+3. Advertising
+
+  Neither the  FreeType authors and  contributors nor you  shall use
+  the name of the  other for commercial, advertising, or promotional
+  purposes without specific prior written permission.
+
+  We suggest,  but do not require, that  you use one or  more of the
+  following phrases to refer  to this software in your documentation
+  or advertising  materials: `FreeType Project',  `FreeType Engine',
+  `FreeType library', or `FreeType Distribution'.
+
+  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
+  accept  it.   However,  as  the FreeType  Project  is  copyrighted
+  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
+  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
+  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  FreeType
+  Project, you indicate that you understand and accept all the terms
+  of this license.
+
+4. Contacts
+
+  There are two mailing lists related to FreeType:
+
+    o freetype@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses general use and applications of FreeType, as well as
+      future and  wanted additions to the  library and distribution.
+      If  you are looking  for support,  start in  this list  if you
+      haven't found anything to help you in the documentation.
+
+    o freetype-devel@nongnu.org
+
+      Discusses bugs,  as well  as engine internals,  design issues,
+      specific licenses, porting, etc.

+      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
+      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
+      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
+      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
+
+      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
+      exercising permissions granted by this License.
+
+      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+      source, and configuration files.
+
+      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+      and conversions to other media types.
+
+      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
+      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
+      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+      as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+      meet the following conditions:
+
+      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+          stating that You changed the files; and
+
+      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+          the Derivative Works; and
+
+      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+          as modifying the License.
+
+      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+      the conditions stated in this License.
+
+   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
+
+   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

+Portions of this software are derived from third-party works licensed
+under terms compatible with the above MIT license:
+
+Much of the math library code (third_party/math/* and
+third_party/complex/*, and third_party/include/libm.h) is
+Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or
+Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or
+Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or
+Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or
+Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier
+and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All
+have been licensed under extremely permissive terms.
+
+The smoothsort implementation (third_party/smoothsort/qsort.c) is
+Copyright © 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style
+license.
+
+The x86_64 files in third_party/arch were written by Nicholas J. Kain
+and is licensed under the standard MIT terms.
+
+All other files which have no copyright comments are original works
+produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either
+by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more
+contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files
+can be found in the git version control history of the project. The
+omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the
+interest of source tree size.
+
+In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files
+(include/* and arch/*/bits/*) and crt files intended to be linked into
+applications (crt/*, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch/*/crt_arch.h) to omit
+the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the
+license, and to use these files without any requirement of
+attribution. These files include substantial contributions from:
+
+Bobby Bingham
+John Spencer
+Nicholas J. Kain
+Rich Felker
+Richard Pennington
+Stefan Kristiansson
+Szabolcs Nagy
+
+all of whom have explicitly granted such permission.
+
+This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of
+the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not
+to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it
+negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of
+permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an
+obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.

+
+A large portion of the dictionary entries
+originate from ICOT Free Software.  The following conditions for ICOT
+Free Software applies to the current dictionary as well.
+
+Each User may also freely distribute the Program, whether in its
+original form or modified, to any third party or parties, PROVIDED
+that the provisions of Section 3 ("NO WARRANTY") will ALWAYS appear
+on, or be attached to, the Program, which is distributed substantially
+in the same form as set out herein and that such intended
+distribution, if actually made, will neither violate or otherwise
+contravene any of the laws and regulations of the countries having
+jurisdiction over the User or the intended distribution itself.
+
+NO WARRANTY
+
+The program was produced on an experimental basis in the course of the
+research and development conducted during the project and is provided
+to users as so produced on an experimental basis.  Accordingly, the
+program is provided without any warranty whatsoever, whether express,
+implied, statutory or otherwise.  The term "warranty" used herein
+includes, but is not limited to, any warranty of the quality,
+performance, merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose of
+the program and the nonexistence of any infringement or violation of
+any right of any third party.
+
+Each user of the program will agree and understand, and be deemed to
+have agreed and understood, that there is no warranty whatsoever for
+the program and, accordingly, the entire risk arising from or
+otherwise connected with the program is assumed by the user.
+
+Therefore, neither ICOT, the copyright holder, or any other
+organization that participated in or was otherwise related to the
+development of the program and their respective officials, directors,
+officers and other employees shall be held liable for any and all
+damages, including, without limitation, general, special, incidental
+and consequential damages, arising out of or otherwise in connection
+with the use or inability to use the program or any product, material
+or result produced or otherwise obtained by using the program,
+regardless of whether they have been advised of, or otherwise had
+knowledge of, the possibility of such damages at any time during the
+project or thereafter.  Each user will be deemed to have agreed to the
+foregoing by his or her commencement of use of the program.  The term
+"use" as used herein includes, but is not limited to, the use,
+modification, copying and distribution of the program and the
+production of secondary products from the program.
+
+In the case where the program, whether in its original form or
+modified, was distributed or delivered to or received by a user from
+any person, organization or entity other than ICOT, unless it makes or
+grants independently of ICOT any specific warranty to the user in
+writing, such person, organization or entity, will also be exempted
+from and not be held liable to the user for any such damages as noted
+above as far as the program is concerned.

+
+OVERVIEW
+========
+
+This package contains C software to implement JPEG image encoding, decoding,
+and transcoding.  JPEG (pronounced "jay-peg") is a standardized compression
+method for full-color and grayscale images.  JPEG's strong suit is compressing
+photographic images or other types of images that have smooth color and
+brightness transitions between neighboring pixels.  Images with sharp lines or
+other abrupt features may not compress well with JPEG, and a higher JPEG
+quality may have to be used to avoid visible compression artifacts with such
+images.
+
+JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output pixels are not necessarily identical to
+the input pixels.  However, on photographic content and other "smooth" images,
+very good compression ratios can be obtained with no visible compression
+artifacts, and extremely high compression ratios are possible if you are
+willing to sacrifice image quality (by reducing the "quality" setting in the
+compressor.)
+
+This software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive
+compression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these
+processes, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.
+We have made no provision for supporting the hierarchical or lossless
+processes defined in the standard.
+
+We provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,
+plus two sample applications "cjpeg" and "djpeg", which use the library to
+perform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.
+The library is intended to be reused in other applications.
+
+In order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included
+considerable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;
+for example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG
+decoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or
+colormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the
+library if not required for a particular application.
+
+We have also included "jpegtran", a utility for lossless transcoding between
+different JPEG processes, and "rdjpgcom" and "wrjpgcom", two simple
+applications for inserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.
+
+The emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and
+flexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,
+the software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the
+REFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to
+be reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have
+achieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.
+
+We welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.
+No royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product
+documentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.
+
+LEGAL ISSUES
+============
+
+In plain English:
+
+1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
+   please let us know!)
+2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
+3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
+   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
+   you've used the IJG code.
+
+In legalese:
+
+The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
+with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
+fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
+its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
+
+This software is copyright (C) 1991-2016, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
+All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
+
+Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
+software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
+conditions:
+(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
+README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
+unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
+must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
+(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
+documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
+the Independent JPEG Group".
+(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
+full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
+NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
+
+These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
+not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
+acknowledge us.
+
+Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
+in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
+it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
+software".
+
+We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
+commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
+assumed by the product vendor.
+
+The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
+It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
+The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
+ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright by X Consortium
+but is also freely distributable.
+
+The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
+To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent (now expired), GIF reading
+support has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified
+to produce "uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW
+algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable
+by all standard GIF decoders.
+
+We are required to state that
+    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated."
+
+REFERENCES
+==========
+
+We recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to
+understand the innards of the JPEG software.
+
+The best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is
+	Wallace, Gregory K.  "The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard",
+	Communications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.
+(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,
+applications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue
+handy, a PDF file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is
+available at http://www.ijg.org/files/Wallace.JPEG.pdf.  The file (actually
+a preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)
+omits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections
+and some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,
+and it may not be used for commercial purposes.
+
+A somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in
+"The Data Compression Book" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by
+M&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides
+good explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods
+including JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C
+code but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG
+sample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look
+at a full implementation, you've got one here...
+
+The best currently available description of JPEG is the textbook "JPEG Still
+Image Data Compression Standard" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L.
+Mitchell, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.
+Price US$59.95, 638 pp.  The book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG
+standards (DIS 10918-1 and draft DIS 10918-2).
+
+The original JPEG standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the actual
+specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1 is
+titled "Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,
+Part 1: Requirements and guidelines" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS
+10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled "Digital Compression and Coding of
+Continuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing" and has document
+numbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.
+
+The JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file
+format.  For the omitted details we follow the "JFIF" conventions, revision
+1.02.  JFIF 1.02 has been adopted as an Ecma International Technical Report
+and thus received a formal publication status.  It is available as a free
+download in PDF format from
+http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/techreports/E-TR-098.htm.
+A PostScript version of the JFIF document is available at
+http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text version at
+http://www.ijg.org/files/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing the figures.
+
+The TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from
+ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme
+found in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.
+IJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).
+Instead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2
+(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from
+http://www.ijg.org/files/.  It is expected that the next revision
+of the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.
+Although IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library
+uses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.

+FILE FORMAT WARS
+================
+
+The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 standards committee (also known as JPEG, together
+with ITU-T SG16) currently promotes different formats containing the name
+"JPEG" which are incompatible with original DCT-based JPEG.  IJG therefore does
+not support these formats (see REFERENCES).  Indeed, one of the original
+reasons for developing this free software was to help force convergence on
+common, interoperable format standards for JPEG files.
+Don't use an incompatible file format!
+(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading existing JPEG
+image files indefinitely.)

+
+2. License Grants and Conditions
+
+2.1. Grants
+
+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
+
+    a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+    b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:
+
+    a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or
+
+    b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or
+
+    c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+    a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+    b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.
+
+6. Disclaimer of Warranty
+
+    Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
+
+7. Limitation of Liability
+
+    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.
+
+8. Litigation
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses
+
+If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

+
+2. License Grants and Conditions
+
+2.1. Grants
+
+Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
+non-exclusive license:
+
+(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
+    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
+    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
+    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
+    as part of a Larger Work; and
+
+(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
+    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
+    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
+
+2.2. Effective Date
+
+The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
+become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
+distributes such Contribution.
+
+2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
+
+The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
+this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
+distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
+Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
+Contributor:
+
+(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
+    or
+
+(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
+    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
+    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
+    Version); or
+
+(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
+    its Contributions.
+
+This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
+or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
+the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
+
+2.4. Subsequent Licenses
+
+No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
+distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
+License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
+permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
+
+2.5. Representation
+
+Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
+Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
+to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
+
+2.6. Fair Use
+
+This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
+applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
+equivalents.
+
+2.7. Conditions
+
+Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
+in Section 2.1.
+
+3. Responsibilities
+
+3.1. Distribution of Source Form
+
+All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
+Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
+the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
+Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
+License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
+attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
+Form.
+
+3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
+
+If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
+
+(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
+    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
+    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
+    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
+    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
+
+(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
+    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
+    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
+    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
+
+3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
+
+You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
+provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
+the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
+Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
+Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
+License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
+under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
+the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
+Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
+License(s).
+
+3.4. Notices
+
+You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
+(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
+or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
+the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
+the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
+
+3.5. Application of Additional Terms
+
+You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
+Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
+behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
+such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
+You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
+liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
+indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
+disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
+jurisdiction.
+
+4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
+
+If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
+License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
+statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
+the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
+describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
+be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
+Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
+or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
+recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
+
+5. Termination
+
+5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
+if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
+compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
+Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
+ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
+non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
+come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
+Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
+notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
+first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
+from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
+Your receipt of the notice.
+
+5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
+infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
+counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
+directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
+You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
+2.1 of this License shall terminate.
+
+5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
+end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
+have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
+prior to termination shall survive termination.
+
+*  6. Disclaimer of Warranty
+
+*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is"
+*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
+*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
+*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
+*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
+*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
+*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
+*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
+*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
+*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
+*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
+
+*  7. Limitation of Liability
+
+*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
+*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
+*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as
+*  permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
+*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
+*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
+*  goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
+*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
+*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
+*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
+*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the
+*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
+*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
+*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
+*  limitation may not apply to You.
+
+8. Litigation
+
+Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
+courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
+place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
+jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
+Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
+cross-claims or counter-claims.
+
+9. Miscellaneous
+
+This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
+matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
+unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
+necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
+that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
+shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
+
+10. Versions of the License
+
+10.1. New Versions
+
+Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
+10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
+publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
+distinguishing version number.
+
+10.2. Effect of New Versions
+
+You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version
+of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,
+or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license
+steward.
+
+10.3. Modified Versions
+
+If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
+create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
+modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
+any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
+such modified license differs from this License).
+
+10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
+Licenses
+
+If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
+Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the
+notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.
+

+file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look
+for such a notice.
+

+   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
+   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
+   source, and configuration files.
+
+   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
+   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
+   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
+   and conversions to other media types.
+
+   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
+   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
+   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
+   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
+
+   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
+   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
+   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
+   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
+   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
+   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
+   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
+
+   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
+   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
+   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
+   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner

+   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
+   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
+   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
+   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
+   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
+   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
+   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
+   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
+
+   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
+   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
+   subsequently incorporated within the Work.
+
+2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
+   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
+   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
+
+3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
+   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
+   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
+   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
+   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
+   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
+   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
+   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
+   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
+   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
+   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
+   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
+   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
+   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
+   as of the date such litigation is filed.
+
+4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
+   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
+   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
+   meet the following conditions:
+
+   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
+       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
+
+   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
+       stating that You changed the files; and
+
+   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
+       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
+       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
+       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
+       the Derivative Works; and
+
+   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
+       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
+       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
+       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
+       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
+       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
+       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
+       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
+       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
+       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
+       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
+       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
+       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
+       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
+       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
+       as modifying the License.
+
+   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
+   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
+   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
+   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
+   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
+   the conditions stated in this License.
+
+5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
+   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
+   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
+   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
+   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
+   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
+   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
+
+6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
+   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
+   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
+   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
+
+7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
+   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
+   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
+   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
+   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
+   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
+   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
+   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
+   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
+
+8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
+   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
+   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
+   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
+   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
+   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
+   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
+   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
+   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
+   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
+   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
+
+9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
+   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
+   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
+   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
+   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
+   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
+   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
+   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
+   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
+   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
